# 2024 MIT Mystery Hunt

Most of my work here is as one of five Editors-in-Chief, and as the student handling the logistics of hosting an event at MIT. I also contributed a few puzzles to the set. More on what I did for the hunt [here](https://bzollern.github.io/2024/06/11/2024-Mystery-Hunt.html).

-   [Asphodel](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2024/mythstoryhunt.world/puzzles/asphodel), a puzzle I wrote to fit the theme of the hunt.
-   [Charon](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2024/mythstoryhunt.world/puzzles/charon), a metapuzzle. I provided the final construction.
-   [Modern Architecture](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2024/mythstoryhunt.world/puzzles/modern-architecture), a four-puzzle suite themed around some buildings. Also contains a Twilight Struggle minipuzzle, because I couldn't resist.
-   [Transcendental Algebra](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2024/mythstoryhunt.world/puzzles/transcendental-algebra), my tribute to the International Linguistics Olympiad and my late mentor Dragomir Radev.
-   [The Myriad Gamut of Hera](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2024/mythstoryhunt.world/puzzles/the-myriad-gamut-of-hera), the metapuzzle which I would certainly consider my best work in the hunt.

There's also a puzzle that didn't make it into the hunt, and has since been published in the epilogue run in March 2025. Its construction process has been detailed [here](https://bzollern.github.io/2025/03/17/Music-for-the-Royal-Fireworks.html).
